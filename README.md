# FLYING BALL

## Waht is this
[Global game jam 2017](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/flying-ball) project, Group F at CLBC Taipei Taiwan, build a game in 48 hours.

We build a 2D side-scrolling game, which player can determine the launch angle of the ball at the beginning, then the ball will fly.  To go to next level, player should let the ball hit the door on the other side of the scene. There are some items in the scene that player can press to affect the flight path of the ball.

Diversifier: This game offers theme variations based on the time of day when you played.

## How to use

This project was built on Unity 5.5.0f3.
